his assignment provides an introduction to basic Python programming concepts. It includes a series of exercises designed to help students understand fundamental Python syntax and operations. Here's a brief overview of each exercise:

Exercise 1: This task focuses on simple output statements using the print() function to display basic information such as your name, student number, and email address.

Exercise 2: This exercise introduces the concept of escape sequences. Students will practice using characters like \n, \t, and \" to format text output in specific ways.

Exercise 3: Students will learn how to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two numbers and output the results.

Exercise 4: This task teaches how to print a sequence of numbers from 1 to 5, which will help students understand how to display a range of values in Python.

Exercise 5: This exercise involves using the print() function to output a sentence with quotation marks and line breaks, demonstrating how to handle more complex string formatting.

Exercise 6: Students will practice using different escape sequences such as \n, \t, and \b to format and manipulate string output.

Exercise 7: This exercise introduces variables and data types in Python. Students will define different types of variables and learn how to convert data types and perform operations on them.

Exercise 8: Students will calculate the total number of minutes in a year using variables to represent the number of days in a year, hours in a day, and minutes in an hour. This will help them understand how to use variables in mathematical expressions.

Exercise 9: This task asks the user to input their name and outputs a personalized greeting. It introduces user input and string formatting.

Exercise 10: In this final task, students will write a program that converts an amount from pounds to dollars, practicing user input and basic mathematical operations.

Overall, the assignment emphasizes key Python concepts such as output formatting, arithmetic operations, variable handling, and user interaction. By completing these exercises, students will build a foundation for writing more complex Python programs and developing problem-solving skills.
